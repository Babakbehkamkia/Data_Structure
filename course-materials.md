* [Here's](http://dl.p30eng.com/p30eng3/Course-booklet-data-structures-www.P30eng.com.zip) a complete and comprehensive booklet on data-building lessons for you dear students of computer engineering or information technology. You can read more about the educational content of the booklet and its headings, and the download link is at the bottom.

## Description :

Data structure is one of the most fundamental topics needed to learn and understand many of the major concepts in computer science. The data building course is also one of the main courses in computer and information technology. Mastery of this course, in addition to being an essential requirement for computer and information technology students, can have a significant impact on accelerating a programmer's programming process.

* [Data Structure and Algorithms Lesson Booklet](http://dl.p30eng.com/p30eng3/notes-data-structures-and-Algorithms-www.p30eng.com.zip)

We have prepared a building lesson booklet and algorithms for you dear users. This booklet is complete and the concepts in this lesson are all embedded in it. Further details and headings of this leaflet are provided below, which you can read if needed. Good luck

## Description :

In the data set of algorithms and algorithms it is attempted to first give the ADT or single data type of each structure, then the implementation and time complexity of each of them is examined, especially the time complexity in different states of the problem is discussed further. . Finally, at the end of each chapter, a few examples are provided to learn more. The booklet contains data structures and algorithms in eight chapters that have been comprehensively and completely provided to dear students. In the first chapter, the reader is required to study the solutions to calculate the algorithm's function and time complexity by studying it, and in particular to acquire the skills needed to calculate and solve recursive relationships.In the following chapters, related topics are described, and at the end of each chapter a number of exercises to complete the instructional scenario, one or more programming projects, are included to fully understand the concepts.
